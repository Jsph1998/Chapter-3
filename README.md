# Chapter-3
This chapter covered the basics of the Dart language. I learned how to comment my code for 
better readability and how to use the main() function that starts the app. I also learned how to declare 
variables to reference different kinds of values such as numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, and more. 
I used the List to store an array of filters and learned how to iterate through each value.  
looked at operator symbols commonly used to perform arithmetic, equality, logical, conditional, and 
cascade notation. The cascade notation is a powerful operator to make multiple sequence calls on the 
same object such as scaling and translating positioning, an object.
